# Avoid The Obstacle

Avoid The Obstacle is a game created using Python with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org). 
## Screenshots
No Screenshots because I am lazy to capture screenshots of my game.

## Background
Press Up To Move Up. Press Down To Move Down. Dodge The Obstacle.

## Usage
### Releases
There is no build as my AV deletes the bulid generated by [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).
### Running from source
Grab the latest release of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **and** install Pygame by executing ``pip install pygame``.

**Note:** If the ``pip install pygame`` did not work for you, then try this:
1. Windows:
``python -m pip install pygame``
2. Mac: 
``python3 -m pip install pygame``
3. Linux:
Same as windows.

Ensure ``main.py`` is in the same directory as ``./assets`` and execute  ``python main.py``.
